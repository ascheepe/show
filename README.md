16bit dos image viewer

## About
A slow simple image viewer for dos. Just to try out some things which
i like to know more about.
Works pretty well for MDA, CGA and VGA. EGA needs a bit of work still.
It would be nice to have better 16 color palette support for it.


## Dependencies
Turbo C 2.01 (other versions not tested)

## Building
After installing the (now free) Turbo C compiler in c:\TC do

    cd SHOW
    \tc\tc

And select build all from the compile menu.
